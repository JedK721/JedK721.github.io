                <h2>About Me</h2>

                <p>I am a diligent and consistent learner, studying Computer Science
                    at the University of Witwatersrand. My passion for computer science 
                    began early in high school, when my uncle exposed me to his field of 
                    work. Since then, I have been fascinated by STEM related subjects.
                    I enjoy problem solving and logic puzzles. In my free time, I play the
                    piano, study languages, and practice Tang Soo Do at the university. I 
                    watch an unhealthy amount of football too! I am a fan of FC Barcelona, 
                    who will be winning the treble this season!

                <h3>Latest Project</h3>

                <p>I am currently trying to build a Fantasy Premier League website clone. This is 
                    mainly for learning purposes. In the future, I would like to create a 
                    separate fantasy football website, but for the South African league. 
                    There has been an increased interest in our league, so I feel like a 
                    game would complement the interest in the league, and get people to watch 
                    all the games.
